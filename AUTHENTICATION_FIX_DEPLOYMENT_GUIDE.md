# Authentication Fix Deployment Guide

## Overview
This guide provides step-by-step instructions to deploy the authentication fixes for FikaConnect and resolve the "Access Denied" issues.

## Files Modified
1. **sender-active-deliveries.html** - Fixed broken authentication logic and added proper imports
2. **driver-dashboard.html** - Fixed driver authentication without automatic document updates
3. **login.html** - Added missing imports for user profile creation
4. **signup.html** - Fixed imports and improved role assignment
5. **firestore.rules** - Created comprehensive security rules

## Critical: Deploy Firebase Security Rules First

### Step 1: Deploy Firestore Security Rules
1. Go to your Firebase Console: https://console.firebase.google.com
2. Select your project: `fika-connect-5f844`
3. Navigate to **Firestore Database** → **Rules**
4. Replace the current rules with the content from `firestore.rules`
5. Click **Publish** to deploy the rules

**Important**: The new rules include a temporary fallback rule at the bottom:
```javascript
match /{document=**} {
  allow read, write: if isAuthenticated();
}
```
This ensures authenticated users can access data while you test. Remove this in production.

### Step 2: Verify Rule Deployment
After publishing, verify the rules are active by checking the Rules tab shows the new content.

## Testing the Authentication Flow

### Test 1: Sender User Authentication
1. Open `signup.html` in your browser
2. Create a new account with **"Register as a Driver" unchecked**
3. Verify you're redirected to `sender-dashboard.html`
4. Navigate to `sender-active-deliveries.html`
5. Verify you can see the page without "Access Denied" errors
6. Check browser console for any errors

### Test 2: Driver User Authentication
1. Open `signup.html` in your browser
2. Create a new account with **"Register as a Driver" checked**
3. Verify you're redirected to `driver-dashboard.html`
4. Verify you can see available bookings without "Access Denied" errors
5. Try to access `sender-active-deliveries.html` - should redirect to driver dashboard

### Test 3: Login Flow
1. Open `login.html`
2. Log in with existing sender credentials
3. Verify redirect to correct dashboard based on user role
4. Log out and log in with driver credentials
5. Verify redirect to driver dashboard

### Test 4: Data Access
1. As a sender, verify you can see your bookings in `sender-active-deliveries.html`
2. As a driver, verify you can see available bookings in `driver-dashboard.html`
3. Check browser console for any permission errors

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### For Sender Users:
- ✅ Can log in successfully
- ✅ Redirected to sender dashboard
- ✅ Can access `sender-active-deliveries.html` without errors
- ✅ Can see their own bookings
- ✅ Cannot access driver dashboard (redirected away)

### For Driver Users:
- ✅ Can log in successfully
- ✅ Redirected to driver dashboard
- ✅ Can see available bookings
- ✅ Can accept bookings
- ✅ Cannot access sender pages (redirected away)

### For Admin Users:
- ✅ Can access admin dashboard
- ✅ Can see all bookings and user data

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still getting "Access Denied"
**Solution**: Ensure Firebase security rules are deployed correctly. Check the Rules tab in Firebase Console.

### Issue: "Insufficient permission" errors
**Solution**: 
1. Verify the user document has the correct `isDriver` field
2. Check browser console for specific permission errors
3. Ensure the user is properly authenticated

### Issue: Users redirected to wrong dashboard
**Solution**: Check the user document in Firestore has the correct `isDriver` value (true for drivers, false for senders).

### Issue: Console errors about missing functions
**Solution**: Clear browser cache and reload the page to ensure updated JavaScript is loaded.

## Database Structure Verification

Ensure your Firestore collections have the correct structure:

### users collection:
```javascript
{
  uid: {
    name: "User Name",
    email: "user@example.com",
    phone: "+256XXXXXXXXX",
    isDriver: false, // true for drivers, false for senders
    createdAt: timestamp
  }
}
```

### bookings collection:
```javascript
{
  bookingId: {
    customerId: "user_uid",
    assignedDriver: "driver_uid", // optional
    status: "Pending Driver Assignment",
    // ... other booking fields
  }
}
```

## Security Notes

1. The current rules include a fallback that allows all authenticated users to read/write
2. In production, remove the fallback rule and rely on specific collection rules
3. Monitor Firebase Console for any rule violations
4. Consider implementing rate limiting for production use

## Next Steps After Deployment

1. Test with real user accounts
2. Monitor Firebase Console for any authentication errors
3. Remove the fallback security rule once everything is working
4. Consider implementing additional security measures like rate limiting
5. Add logging for authentication events

## Support

If you encounter issues after deployment:
1. Check Firebase Console → Authentication for user login attempts
2. Check Firestore → Usage for any rule violations
3. Review browser console for JavaScript errors
4. Verify all files are properly uploaded to your web server
